    <h1>Introduction to JavaScript</h1>
    <p>JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that enables developers to create dynamic and interactive experiences on the web. Originally developed by Brendan Eich at Netscape in 1995, JavaScript has evolved to become one of the most widely used programming languages worldwide. Its primary purpose is to enhance the functionality and interactivity of websites, transforming static HTML pages into dynamic user experiences.</p>
    
    <p>JavaScript is often referred to as a "client-side" language because it is executed directly within the user's web browser. However, with the advent of technologies like Node.js, JavaScript has expanded its capabilities to "server-side" programming, allowing developers to build full-stack applications using a single language. This versatility makes JavaScript an essential tool for modern web development.</p>

    <p>Some of the key features of JavaScript include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Event-Driven Programming:</strong> JavaScript allows you to respond to user interactions, such as clicks, form submissions, or mouse movements, making web applications more interactive.</li>
        <li><strong>Object-Oriented:</strong> JavaScript supports object-oriented programming, enabling developers to create reusable and modular code structures.</li>
        <li><strong>Lightweight and Fast:</strong> JavaScript is designed to be lightweight, with rapid execution in modern web browsers thanks to Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation.</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-Browser Compatibility:</strong> JavaScript works seamlessly across different browsers, ensuring a consistent user experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Integration:</strong> JavaScript integrates easily with other web technologies like HTML and CSS, providing a cohesive framework for building web applications.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Over the years, JavaScript has grown beyond the browser environment. With the introduction of libraries and frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue.js, as well as runtime environments like Node.js, JavaScript has become a cornerstone of web development, powering everything from single-page applications (SPAs) to complex server-side systems.</p>

    <p>Learning JavaScript opens up a world of possibilities, from building interactive websites to creating mobile and desktop applications, developing games, and even working with emerging technologies like machine learning and IoT (Internet of Things). Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, mastering JavaScript is a valuable skill that will continue to be in demand for years to come.</p>

    <h2>Why Learn JavaScript?</h2>
    <p>JavaScript is widely used in web development and offers several benefits:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Client-Side Scripting:</strong> JavaScript runs directly in the browser, making it ideal for creating responsive and interactive user interfaces.</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-Platform:</strong> JavaScript works on almost all web browsers and operating systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Rich Ecosystem:</strong> With libraries and frameworks like React, Angular, and Node.js, JavaScript extends beyond browsers to server-side programming, mobile apps, and more.</li>
        <li><strong>Community Support:</strong> A large developer community ensures abundant resources, tutorials, and tools.</li>
    </ul>
